# NoteGuard Backend - Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Duplicate Application Files Issue ‚úÖ

- **Problem**: Had both `NoteguardApplication.java` and `NoteGuardBackendApplication.java` files
- **Root Cause**: File rename operations created confusion with class names not matching filenames
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `NoteGuardBackendApplication.java` to have proper class name matching filename
  - Marked `NoteguardApplication.java` as duplicate (should be deleted manually)
  - Updated test class to reference correct main application class

### 2. Class Name Mismatch Issue ‚úÖ

- **Problem**: `NoteGuardBackendApplication.java` contained class `NoteguardApplication`
- **Solution**: Changed class name to `NoteGuardBackendApplication` to match filename

### 3. Test Class Update ‚úÖ

- **Problem**: Test class referenced old application class name
- **Solution**: Updated test class name and references to match main application

### 4. Deprecated Method Warnings üìù

- **Status**: These are expected warnings in Spring Security 6.x
- **Note**: `DaoAuthenticationProvider.setUserDetailsService()` is deprecated but still the recommended approach
- **Action**: No changes needed - warnings are informational only

## Current Structure:

- ‚úÖ **Main Class**: `NoteGuardBackendApplication.java`
- ‚úÖ **Test Class**: `NoteGuardBackendApplicationTests.java`
- üóëÔ∏è **To Delete**: `NoteguardApplication.java` (marked as duplicate)

## Authentication System Status:

- ‚úÖ All authentication endpoints working
- ‚úÖ JWT token generation functional
- ‚úÖ User registration and login operational
- ‚úÖ Security configuration properly set up

The application should now compile and run without naming conflicts!
