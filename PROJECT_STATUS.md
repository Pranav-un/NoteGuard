# NoteGuard - Project Status Summary

## 🎉 Cleanup Complete!

### ✅ Successfully Resolved Issues:

1. **Fixed Import Errors**: Updated routes/index.tsx to import from correct file names (LoginPage, RegisterPage instead of LoginPageModern, RegisterPageModern)

2. **Fixed DashboardPage.tsx**: Completely recreated the file with clean Tailwind CSS styling, removing corrupted SVG icon remnants

3. **Fixed CSS Import Order**: Moved Google Fonts import to the top of globals.css to resolve PostCSS warnings
